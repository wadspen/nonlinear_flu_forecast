\section{Additional plots for ILI \& Hospitalization data for select regions,
         results from simulation study, and 2023-24 flu analysis}

Figure \ref{fig:ili_vs_week} shows ILI data from five states and the District of Columbia, locations which received particular attention in \cite{osthus2021multiscale}. The plots include the ILI data for all seasons from 2010 to 2023 in grey, and the black line is the per week ILI average over seasons. The patterns in the individual states are similar to the national level plots in that the ILI rises in the fall and winter until it peaks and descends as the spring and summer progress. For these locations ILI regularly peaks, either locally or globally, at or near week 22. 

 \begin{figure}[hbt!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=.5]{Images/ili_vs_week.png}
    \caption{Percentage of outpatient visits with an influenza-like illness (ILI) in five different states and the District of Columbia for seasons 2010 to 2023. Week 1 is the first week of August of the year the flu season begins and the last week of the season is the last week of July of the following year.
     Plots include lines for ILI\% from the 2010 flu season to 2023 (grey) and for the weekly ILI averaged over all seasons (black).}
    \label{fig:ili_vs_week}
\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:hosp_vs_week} shows the 2022 and 2023 weekly hospitalizations for the same states from \ref{fig:ili_vs_week}. Similar to the national data, the peak in 2022 came early compared to the peak of 2023. Comparing figures \ref{fig:ili_vs_week} and \ref{fig:hosp_vs_week} shows that ILI and hospitalizations share the similar pattern of increasing to a peak in the winter and decreasing thereafter. 

\begin{figure}[hbt!]
    \centering

\end{figure}





% Figure \ref{fig:ili_vs_hosp} shows scatter plots with ILI\% on the $x$-axes and hospitalizations on the $y$-axes, revealing a positive somewhat linear relationship between the two variables. This relationship motivates the forecast models outlined in the next section.

% \section{Additional results plots from simulation study}


Figures \ref{fig:overall_scores} - \ref{fig:logs_by_season} show boxplots of the CRPS and logarithmic score (LogS) for the four models for 500 simulation replicates. Figure \ref{fig:logs_by_week_horizon} shows 
boxplots of the LogS faceted by week and horizon. Figure \ref{fig:overall_scores} shows that the variation of overall CRPS is smallest for the ASG models and larger for the SIR models. The median scores for the SIR models also appears slightly higher than for the ASG models. 
When faceted by season in figure \ref{fig:crps_by_season}, the boxplots of the CRPS often show the same pattern for ASG and SIR models but not always. For example, the bulk of CRPS values for the SIRD model in 2019 appears to have smaller variation than the other models.
The LogS plots show similar results to the CRPS plots, though there are some differences. For example, SIRD in figure \ref{fig:logs_by_season} tends to show smaller LogS variation relative to the other three models than is seen by the CRPS of SIRD in figure \ref{fig:crps_by_season}.

The LogS is defined in (\ref{eq:logs2}) where $f(\cdot)$ is the forecast density function and $y^*$ is the observed value. To calculate the LogS when given MCMC samples from a posterior predictive distribution, a continuous density function was first estimated via kernel density estimation, and the \texttt{scoringRules} package in \texttt{R} is used for the calculation \cite[]{jordan2019scoring}.

\begin{equation}
    \text{LogS}(f, y^*) = -\text{log}(f(y^*))
    \label{eq:logs2}
\end{equation}

% \section{Additional results plots for 2023-24 flu analysis}

In figure \ref{fig:lwis_by_traj_loc}, it appears that both the SIR and ASG models which include discrepancy perform slightly better than the models which do not.

    \includegraphics[scale = .7]{Images/lwis_by_traj_loc.png}

Scores are averaged over all horizons 1-4 weeks ahead. Scores are faceted by ILI model function (columns) and by whether or not discrepancy modeling was included (rows). The lighter the shade, the lower the LWIS with low LWIS being better.}

\section{Posterior distribution plots for select parameters}
\label{app:B_prior}

The figures in this section show 95\% credible intervals for model parameters under the several modeling schemes along with the prior distributions assigned to the parameters. Figure \ref{fig:posterior_theta_sir} is for parameters unique to the SIR ILI model. Figures \ref{fig:posterior_theta} and \ref{fig:posterior_zeta} are for parameters unique to the ASG models. Figure \ref{fig:sir_asg_shared} is for parameters shared by SIR and ASG models, including parameters used for modeling discrepancy. Figures \ref{fig:hosp_lin_params} and \ref{fig:hosp_nus_param} are for parameters used in hospitalization modeling.

Figure \ref{fig:lwis_by_dist_loc} also shows weekly forecast performance by 
LWIS, but all 53 locations are included. The LWIS is shown across the whole 
season faceted by hospitalization model distribution. Overall, the weeks 
leading up to week 22 are the most difficult to forecast, but the LNORM model 
appears to perform the better than the other models during the weeks around 
the holiday week 22. 
The overall, calculated as the mean LWIS over all locations and weeks, for all 
24 models is shown in table \ref{tab:forecast_scores}. The first main takeaway 
is that the top four performing models are SIR ILI models with the LNORM 
hospitalization models. The next main takeaway is that overall the models 
which include discrepancy outperformed the models without discrepancy.

\section{FluSight forecast competition scoring results} \label{app:A_rwis}

In the CDC flu forecast competition, a baseline forecast was made to which all other forecasts were compared. The baseline forecast for a given state and week had as a median the most recent observed hospitalization count. The uncertainty was based on differences between previous hospitalizations, and is similar to the baseline forecast used in previous flu forecasting seasons and in the COVID-19 hub \cite[]{mathis2024evaluation, cramer2022evaluation}. 
The RWIS for one model was calculated by first taking the ratio of the average LWIS paired with every other model. This was then diveded by the same ratio for the baseline forecasts (see methods in \cite{mathis2024evaluation} for details).
 An RWIS less than 1 indicates the forecast outperformed the baseline forecast.
 Figures \ref{fig:rwis_ili_tile} and \ref{fig:rwis_hosp_tile} show the mean RWIS of hospitalization forecasts over all 24 models from the main manuscript for all locations and weeks of the 2023 flu season. Some similar patterns to those noted in section the manuscript emerge, including a slightly better performance by forecasts including discrepancy modeling over those which do not include discrepancy modeling and better overall performance by the SIR models than by the ASG forecast models. Interestingly, figure \ref{fig:rwis_hosp_tile} shows the LNORM model showing especially poor RWIS performance about three quarters into the season. This was not seen in the LWIS in the main manuscript. %figure \ref{fig:lwis_by_dist_loc}.

\end{figure}


Figure \ref{fig:state_median_points} shows the mean over weeks RWIS for the SIR and ASG forecast models with an RWIS less than 1 for the most locations. The plot on the left is from a forecast by an SIRD ILI model and a quadratic NORM hospitalization model. This forecast model had an RWIS less than 1 for 37 out of 53 locations. The plot on the right is from a forecast by an ASGD ILI model and linear NORM hospitalization model. This model had an RWIS less than 1 for 34 out of 53 locations.

\section{Prior distributions}

The prior distributions under the SIR model are in (\ref{eq:sir_prior}). 
Because we set $S_{0s} = 0.9$, prior distributions were assigned only to 
$I_{0s}$, $\beta_s$ and $\rho_s$, recalling the parameter for the recovery 
rate $\delta_s = \rho_s \beta_s$. Here $\vmathbb{1}_{A}$ represents the 
indicator function for values within the set $A$.

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \label{eq:sir_prior}
        I_{0s} &\sim N(0.005, 0.03) \vmathbb{1}_{(0, .1)} \\
        \beta_s &\sim N^+(0.8, 0.3) \\
        \rho_s &\sim N^+(0.68, 0.08)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
For the ASG model, the MLE 
$\hat{\theta}_s = (\hat{\lambda}_s, \hat{\eta}_s, \hat{\mu}_s, \hat{\sigma}_{1s}^2, \hat{\sigma}_{2s}^2)$ 
was calculated. % and $\hat{\lambda}_s$ was accepted as a fixed value. 
These estimates were used as starting values for posterior sampling. 
The transformation 
$T(\theta_s) = (\lambda_s, \text{log}(\eta_s), \mu_s, \text{log}(\sigma_{1s}^2), \text{log}(\sigma_{2s}^2))$ 
was made, and a prior distribution was assigned to $T(\theta_s)$.
The prior distributions for the ILI model under the ASG function are shown 
in (\ref{eq:ili_prior}). These are slightly informative priors because for 
most parameters we have an idea what reasonable values may be. Here 
$m = (-4.5, 0.3, 23, 3.69, 4.7)$ and $C = \text{diag}(0.3, 0.2, 5, 2, 2)$
where $\text{diag}(\cdot)$ 
is the diagonal matrix for the given entries.


\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:ili_prior}
                T(\theta_s) &\overset{ind}{\sim} MVN(\theta, \Sigma) \\
                T(\theta) &\overset{ind}{\sim} MVN(m, C)\\
                \Sigma &= \text{diag}(\zeta^2_1,...,\zeta^2_4) \\
                \zeta_i &\overset{ind}{\sim} N^+(0,4^2)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Parameters shared by both the SIR and ASG models are the scale parameter 
$\kappa_s$ and the discrepancy parameters $\sigma_{\gamma}^2$ and 
$\sigma_{\gamma_W}^2$. These priors are in (\ref{eq:shared_ili_priors}). 

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    \label{eq:shared_ili_priors}
        \kappa_s &\overset{ind}{\sim} N^+(0, 10,000^2) \\
        \sigma_{\gamma}^2 &\sim N^+(0, .02^2) \\
        \sigma_{\gamma_W}^2 &\sim N^+(\hat{\sigma}_W^2, 1^2) \\
        \sigma_{\upsilon_{s,w}} &\sim N^+(0, .1^2)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Because of the limited information for estimating $\sigma_{\gamma_W}^2$, 
we selected an informative prior distribution by first estimating  
$\hat{\sigma}_{\gamma_W}^2$. This was estimated for a given state by first 
calculating the MLE for $\theta_s$. 
% We set the likelihood function as $\mathcal{L}(\theta_s) = \prod_{w = 1}^W f_{\theta_s}(w)$ and  calculated $\hat{\theta}_s$ where $\label{eq:theta_hat}
%     \hat{\theta}_s = \underset{\theta_s}{\mathrm{argmin}} \, \mathcal{L}(\theta_s)$.
$\widehat{ILI}_{s,w}$ was then predicted such that 
$\text{logit}(\widehat{ILI}_{s,W}) = f_{\hat{\theta}_s}(W)$ for each season. 
Then $\hat{\sigma}_{\gamma_W}^2$ was calculated as the estimated variance over 
seasons of the differences 
$\text{logit}(\widehat{ILI}_{s,w}) - \text{logit}(ILI_{s,w})$. 
When $f_{\theta_s}(w)$ was the SIR function, $\widehat{\theta}_s$ was 
calculated using the \texttt{mle2} function in the \texttt{bblme} package 
\cite[]{bolker2023bblme} and the \texttt{ode} function in the \texttt{deSolve} 
package \cite[]{soetaert2010desolve} function in \texttt{R}. Where the ASG 
function was used,  $\hat{\theta}_s$ was calculated using the \texttt{optim} 
function.
The prior for the hospitalization models are in (\ref{eq:shared_hosp_priors}).

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\label{eq:shared_hosp_priors}
        \alpha_{0s} &\overset{ind}{\sim} N(0, 5^2)\\
        \alpha_{1s} &\overset{ind}{\sim} N(0, 5^2)\\
        \alpha_{2s} &\overset{ind}{\sim} N(0, 5^2) \\
        \phi &\sim N(0, .4)\vmathbb{1}_{(-1,1)} \\
        \sigma_{\epsilon_s} &\overset{ind}{\sim} N^+(0, 4^2) \\
        \omega_s &\overset{ind}{\sim} N^+(0, 15^2)
\end{aligned}
